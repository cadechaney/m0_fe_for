# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
After taking a break and revising, I have a better understanding. I still would like to review.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 
I had unproductive struggle were I couldn't even focus. After a break I was able to zone back in.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Yes I need to adjust my calendar in order to study more. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I will reach out to kaitlyn, talk to my small group and use the study hall.
