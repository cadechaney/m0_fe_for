# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Not confident, I need to revise.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 
I was working productively but it is getting too late.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Yes I need to adjust my calendar in order to study more. I'm waking up early tomorrow morning to revise and study.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I will reach out to kaitlyn and go to the study hall.
